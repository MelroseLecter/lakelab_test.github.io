##### Understanding intelligence

Today's AI provides nothing like the general purpose, flexible intelligence that we have as humans. We are studying the ingredients of intelligence that enable fast and flexible learning.

##### About the lab
In 2017, [Dr. Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) started the Human and Machine Learning Lab at NYU. We are located in the New York City neighborhood of Greenwich Village at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) (60 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10011). We are also part of the [NYU Department of Psychology](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/psychology.html), the larger NYU AI group known as the [CILVR lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/), and the [Computational Cognitive Science](http://nyuccl.org/cogsci/) community at NYU.
