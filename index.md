##### Understanding intelligence

Today's AI provides nothing like the general purpose, flexible intelligence that we have as humans. Our lab aims to understand the ingredients of intelligence that enable fast and flexible learning. We want to build machines that learn and think like people.

##### About the Lab
In 2017, [Dr. Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) started the Human and Machine Learning Lab at NYU. We are located in the New York City neighborhood of Greenwich Village at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) (60 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10011). We are also part of the [NYU Department of Psychology](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/psychology.html), the larger NYU AI group known as the [CILVR lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/), and the [Computational Cognitive Science](http://nyuccl.org/cogsci/) community at NYU.
