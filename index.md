##### __About the lab__
In 2017, [Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) started the Human & Machine Learning Lab at NYU. We are located in the New York City neighborhood of Greenwich Village at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) (60 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10011). We are also part of the [NYU Department of Psychology](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/psychology.html), the larger NYU AI group known as the [CILVR lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/), and the [Computational Cognitive Science](http://nyuccl.org/cogsci/) community at NYU.
