##### Understanding intelligence

Today's AI provides nothing like the general purpose, flexible intelligence that we have as humans. We are studying the ingredients of intelligence that enable fast and flexible learning.

##### Bulletin
- **5/2021:** The has 5 papers appearing at CogSci2020 on [visual compositional learning](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/ZhouLake2021CogSci.pdf), [modeling human category learning from pixels](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/TartagliniEtAl2021CogSci.pdf), [infant relation categorization](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/DavidsonLake2021CogSci.pdf), [the ARC challenge](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/JohnsonEtAl2021CogSci.pdf), and [question asking](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/WangLake2021CogSci.pdf).
- **1/2021:** Reuben presents paper at ICLR on [generative neuro-symbolic modeling](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/FeinmanLake2021ICLR.pdf).
- **9/2020:** The lab presents 4 paper at NeurIPS2020: [learning through a child's eyes](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/2007.16189.pdf), [the gSCAN challenge for compositional learning](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/2003.05161.pdf), [neuro-symbolic rule learning](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/2003.05562.pdf), and [the ME challenge for deep nets](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/papers/1906.10197.pdf).

##### About the lab
In 2017, [Dr. Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) started the Human and Machine Learning Lab at NYU. We are located in the New York City neighborhood of Greenwich Village at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) (60 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10011). We are also part of the [NYU Department of Psychology](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/psychology.html), the larger NYU AI group known as the [CILVR lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/), and the [Computational Cognitive Science](http://nyuccl.org/cogsci/) community at NYU.
