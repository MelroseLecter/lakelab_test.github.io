### __Join us__

Interested in joining the Human & Machine Learning Lab? Interested candidates can apply through the links below. More generally, NYU offers very strong training in [computational cognitive science](http://nyuccl.org/cogsci/) and [artificial intelligence](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/).

##### __Postdoctoral researchers__
We consider postdoc candidates on a case-by-case basis. Please reach out to [Brenden](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) if you are interested in a postdoc position.

<hr class='invis'>
##### __Ph.D. candidates__
Interested Ph.D. candidates are encouraged to apply to either the 
[Ph.D. Program in Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/admissions/phd-requirements/) (deadline usually December 1). 
or the [Ph.D. Program in Cognition and Perception](http://as.nyu.edu/psychology/graduate/phd-cognition-perception.html) (deadline usually  December 1).

In exceptional cases, it is possible to join the lab through the Ph.D. Program in Computer Science and the Ph.D. Program in Neural Science, but it is strongly recommended that you apply through either Data Science or Cognition and Perception.

[University policy](http://gsas.nyu.edu/admissions/gsas-application-resource-center/nyu-gsas-general-application-policies.html#3) states that you may only apply to one program at a time.

##### __Current Master's and undergraduates at NYU__

We are glad that you are interested in research, although sadly we have a limited number of spots for Master's and undergraduate researchers. The usual path is to take one of Brenden's courses and do very well, as a stepping stone to starting a research project, although sometimes there are exceptions. You are welcome to reach out to [Brenden](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) and ask about opportunities.

##### __Visitors, research assistants, and summer interns__

Unfortunately, the lab does not offer positions for research assistants or summer interns. We also cannot host visiting researchers.
