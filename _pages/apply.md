<!-- We are glad that you are interested in research. We have a limited number of spots, and applications are currently closed. They will reopen from September 1, 2024 to October 15, 2024, where you can apply through a link posted here. -->

We are glad that you are interested in research. We have a limited number of spots for these opportunities, although we encourage you to apply. To apply, please fill out this [web form](https://forms.gle/XjDdgBHbk1VfBcSe7).

##### __Ph.D. candidates__
Interested Ph.D. candidates are encouraged to apply to either the 
[Ph.D. Program in Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/admissions/phd-requirements/) (deadline usually December 1). 
or the [Ph.D. Program in Cognition and Perception](http://as.nyu.edu/psychology/graduate/phd-cognition-perception.html) (deadline usually  December 1).

In exceptional cases, it is possible to join the lab through the Ph.D. Program in Computer Science and the Ph.D. Program in Neural Science, but it is strongly recommended that you apply through either Data Science or Cognition and Perception.

[University policy](http://gsas.nyu.edu/admissions/gsas-application-resource-center/nyu-gsas-general-application-policies.html#3) states that you may only apply to one program at a time.
