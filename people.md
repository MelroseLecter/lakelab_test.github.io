Brenden is an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Data Science at New York University. He received his M.S. and B.S. in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University in 2009, and his Ph.D. in Cognitive Science from MIT in 2014. He was a postdoctoral Data Science Fellow at NYU from 2014-2017. Brenden is a recipient of the Robert J. Glushko Prize for Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation in Cognitive Science, he is a MIT Technology Review Innovator Under 35, and his research was selected by Scientific American as one of the most important advances of 2016. Brenden's research focuses on computational problems that are easier for people than they are for machines, such as learning new concepts, creating new concepts, learning-to-learn, and asking questions.

### Emin Orhan
##### Postdoc
<img src="/images/bios/emin-orhan-cropped.jpg" width="300" height="500">

I obtained my PhD in Brain & Cognitive Sciences from the University of Rochester. I was previously a postdoc at the Center for Neural Science at NYU and then jointly at Rice University & Baylor College of Medicine. My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, cognitive science, and computational neuroscience. Broadly speaking, my research has three main goals: 1) Understanding how current deep learning models work, as well as characterizing their failure modes. 2) Comparing the behavior of deep learning models with qualitative and quantitative data from cognitive science and experimental neuroscience to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of natural intelligence and to point out ways in which these models can be improved. 3) Based on the insights gleaned from the first two goals, improving the current generation of deep learning models.
